Fun to play around with, this music sequencer uses [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to play the sounds.

It also uses machine learning, via something called a recurrant neural network, to generate the drums based on your synth. The music meachine learning is done using the library [magenta.js](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js) (which is based on tensorflow.js)
