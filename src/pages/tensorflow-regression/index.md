This is an interactive visualisation for finding the 'line of best fit' for different types of Regression.
Built by Chandra Kanth, it includes options where the user can specify the type of regression - Linear, Binomial or Trinomial.
 You can also can select the type of optimizer - [stochastic gradient descent or Adam](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/).

To use, draw a line of dots across the page by holding down the mouse, then see the model update and train itself to find the best-fit line based on these points.
