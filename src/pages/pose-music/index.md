This project accesses your webcam, then plays a continuous loop of music which changes pitches based on how high or low your arms are.

Check out the [Demo](https://codepen.io/teropa/full/QxLrMp/) over on CodePen and see if you can change the frequency of this musical loop by moving your arms.

It was built by [Tero Parviainen](https://teropa.info/)
