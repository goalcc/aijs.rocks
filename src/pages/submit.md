To submit you can simply create a Pull Request to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/aijavascript/aijs.rocks) and
one of our editors will approve and merge, or feedback if rejected.

Please note the following submission guidelines:

1. Only submit one piece of content per Pull Request
2. Needs to be built in JavaScript - can be vanilla JavaScript, use any JavaScript library, or even just use an API relating to AI
3. Can use AI in any way ie. 'The simulation of a human brain function by machines'.
4. Must include a demo link, something people can click on and play around with.
5. Must be open-source, so people can view the code and see how it was built.

To create a Pull Request, create a folder inside `/pages/`, and add a markdown file (see `/example-post.md`) and any images.
Please note you will need to include meta data at the top section of the markdown file such as the title, date etc.
