[SeeClarke.js](https://github.com/labofoz/SeeClarke.js) is a project which uses your webcam to track head movements and to y these to your cursor position.
It's posibile to apply this to a variable number of users at once, and the model is fast enough to work on mid-ranged mobile devices.

The main SeeClarke npm package only handles the calculations, but there are
a bunch of demos which the creator, Oz Ramos, has applied these, such as
[basic cursor positioning](https://codepen.io/labofoz/full/RBKKvW/),
[page scrolling](https://codepen.io/labofoz/full/XBpMVv/),
[focusing elements](https://codepen.io/labofoz/full/ZjLKBb/),
[panning Google Maps](https://codepen.io/labofoz/full/ajpWQL),
[looking around Street Views](https://codepen.io/labofoz/full/WKRZZq), and
[looking around YouTube 360 videos](https://codepen.io/labofoz/full/VBPMEd/).
