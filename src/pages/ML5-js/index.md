# Machine learning for the web!

## Now you can build machine learning models right in your browser.

ml5.js is a friendly high level interface to TensorFlow.js, a library for handling GPU-accelerated mathematical operations and memory management for machine learning algorithms.

Check it out at [ml5js.org](https://ml5js.org/)

ml5.js aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies.

The library is supported by code examples, tutorials, and sample datasets with an emphasis on ethical computing. Bias in data, stereotypical harms, and responsible crowdsourcing are part of the documentation around data collection and usage.

The library also aims to introduce students and creative coders to the entire machine learning process: from collecting data, cleaning data, training a model, testing a model, and deploying.
