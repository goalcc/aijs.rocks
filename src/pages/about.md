[aijs.rocks](https://aijs.rocks/) is a collection of AI-driven projects written in JavaScript.

Artificial Intelligence, ie. _the simulation of a human brain function by machines_,
covers areas such as perception (vision, touch, hearing), actions and movements
(robotics, the ability to move and manipulate objects), natural language processing (speech, text),
planning, reasoning and knowledge, and a whole lot more.

JavaScript is a great language to build machine learning and AI projects in -
it's one of the most versitile languages around, and it's the only
language which works in the browser.

The browser is a fantastic platform for AI applications, as it's not only
 portable, accessible everywhere and available across multiple devices, but the
 browser is a place for processing user interaction data, be it via a camera,
 mouse clicks or text input, then potentially gps, gyroscope, bluetooth and more,
 depending on the device.

Recent developments of machine leraning / AI libraries for JavaScript such as
TensorFlow.js and ml5.js, and the subsequent emergence of projects being
built using these technologies, spurred the creation of aijs.rocks
as a place to showcase these projects.

aijs.rocks was built by [Asim Hussain](https://twitter.com/jawache), [Eleanor Haproff](https://twitter.com/EleanorHaproff) and [Osama Jandali](https://twitter.com/osama_jandali).

[Asim](https://codecraft.tv/) and Eleanor also run the London Meetup [AI JavaScript](https://www.meetup.com/AI-JavaScript-London/).
