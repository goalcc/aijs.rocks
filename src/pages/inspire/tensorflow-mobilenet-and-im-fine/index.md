Use the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to find images based on a search term. Then uses the [MobileNet Tensorflow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model which tries to guess what's in the image.

There are now some [pretty advanced APIs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) where you can pass an image and it will tell you whats in it. Using mobilenet you can do the same but all locally in your browser.

Ok, it's not as good as the APIs but it's local and it doesn't require a network connection. You could imagine using MobileNet locally, and then if it does identify something interesting in the image you can pass it to a more powerfull API to find out more.
