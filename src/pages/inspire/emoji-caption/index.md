This a simple PWA that takes in an image URL, processes it with Azure's Computer Vision API and generates a caption in the form of emojis! (along with a corresponding written caption - but that's boring, right?).

Uses [emojilib](https://github.com/muan/emojilib) for generating associated emojis (in some cases, multiple emojis may be relevant for the generated caption, so a 'generate again' button is available).
