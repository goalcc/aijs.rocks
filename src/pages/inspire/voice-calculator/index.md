Great example of controlling apps through voice, built by [Brian Holt](https://twitter.com/holtbt) this codepen demonstrates how to use the [language understanding service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-service/?WT.mc_id=luiscalculator-twitter-brholt) from Azure to create a calculator.

Simply speak the numbers and the maths operations you want to apply and and the pen will caclulate it for you.
