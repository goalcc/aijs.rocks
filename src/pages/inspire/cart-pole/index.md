This project is trying to solve the classic [cart-pole balancing problem](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/), sometimes refered to as the 'hello world' of reinforcement
learning.


Specifically, it showcases an implementation of the policy-gradient method in TensorFlow.js with a combination of the layers and gradients API.
